                and in theory the blockquote is supposed to be indented to set it apart from the rest of your text.  Oh well, this page is just practice after all, I'm sure I'll figure it out soon.

            In the anchor tag set the href equal to the desired url, either absolute or local. Links don't have to be the default underlined blue or purple, this can be changed in css. Another attribute in the anchor tag is target, this can be set equal to _blank, _self, _top, _parent, or a particular frame name. _self is default, _blank is most common, _top helps you break out of a frame. <br />Note: border:0; is added to prevent IE9 (and earlier) from displaying a border around the image (when the image is a link).<br />In many tags the title attribute will provide a place for you to enter a mouse-hover tooltip. Remember to distinguish this from the alt attribute which enables you to enter a description as a placeholder for absent images or for screen-readers for visually disabled.
        </p>
        <h3>
            bookmarks
        </h3>
        <p>
            Inserting what appears to be a css ID attribute into a tag is a way to place a bookmark. When a link is clicked that has HashtagIDname in it the browser will jump to that bookmark. If there is a full-path or local url before the HashtagIDname the browser will jump out to that url, not just within the current page. As you know you can use an img as the clickable link, it doesn't have to be text.
        </p>
        <h3>
            images
        </h3>
        <p>
            in the image tag img the source file is named after src and the alternate text (which IS required) is defined after alt. The image tag is self closing, so doesn't get a separate closing tag.<br />You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image, and this can be specified as a percentage. Or you can use width and height attributes which require values in pixels.<br />Again, if you use style it can be an inline attribute or an internal tag in the page's head.<br />Use the map tag to define an image-map. An image-map is an image with clickable areas. The name attribute of the map tag is associated with the img's usemap attribute (which begins with a hashtag) if they match and establishes the relationship. The map tag contains area tags which define the clickable areas.<br />To add a background image on a web page, specify the background-image property on the body element: style="background-image:url('YourImage.jpg')"
