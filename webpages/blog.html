		08/11/16<br/>
		I've felt so alone all week. She slept all day Sunday.<br/>
		She has stayed home from work 4 days.<br/>
		Even though there are plenty of household tasks that she usually does after work,<br/>
		even with all of this time off work zero has been accomplished.<br/>
		She says she'll go to work tomorrow (friday) but I have my doubts.<br/>
		It seems like I irritate her with my mere presence.<br/>
		There are big questions, big decisions looming! Some are very close, some others on the horizon.<br/>
		Where do I go?  What should I do for us?  Where do we move to?<br/>
		I certainly must not just make these decisions on my own.<br/>
		I would, but it wouldn't be fair and would cause major conflict.<br/>
		But trying to talk, even in the form of asking for help,<br/>
		runs me up against a wall of her frustration and irritation.<br/>
		Her final communication early this evening, after our first conversation of the week failed,<br/>
		was that she wanted to be left alone the rest of the night.  <br/>So here I am again.  <br/>Alone.

			<li>Close the front door!
				<br/>Most of the year we spend real money to control the indoor temperature.
				<br/>It is no surprise to me that your daughter has the bad habit of leaving the front door hanging open:
				<br/>she got that habit from you!</li>
			<li>Close cabinets and drawers after you've used them.</li>
			<li>Close containers after you've used them, don't just set the lid back on.</li>
			<li>Clear the timer on the microwave!
				<br/>It only takes one single press of a button and makes it easier for the next person to use it.</li>
			<li>Remove your laundry from the dryer on the same day you dried it and carry it upstairs!</li>
			<li>Clean out the lint trap on the dryer after you've dried a load.</li>
			<li>Remove laundry from the washer the same day you washed it and put it directly into the dryer and start it.</li>
			<li>These are simple actions that demonstrate that you are aware that somebody around you has equal value; that you are not a princess.</li>

		When a woman advocating abortion declares "its MY body so its MY decision" I'll ask for clarification: what is "it"? are you speaking of the fetus? 
		If so, I emphatically disagree!  The fetus is not your body, it is not PART of your body! Your body is temporarily the host to an entirely unique new human. 
		His/her DNA, while quite similar to yours is irrefutably unique. 
		Although this new life is temporarily dependent on your body to supply an adequate environment for development, it is NOT merely another part of your body.

		"Simple morality dictates that unless and until someone can prove the unborn human is not alive, 
		we must give it the benefit of the doubt and assume it is (alive). And, thus, it should be entitled to life, 
		liberty and the pursuit of happiness." 
		~Ronald Reagan

		Abortion advocates don't claim its not a human, of course it is a human embryo. their agrument is that it is human, but not a person yet. 
		they claim it is part of the mother's body, just a piece of her flesh. If they can ignore the miniature human body parts, there is still the issue of the unique DNA. 
		They might try to argue that the baby's lack of ability to stay alive independently negates its claim to personhood. 
		Would they argue the same about an adult surviving on life support in the hospital?
		Whether a human is on mechanical life support just before the end of life, or organic life support just after the beginning, he or she is a PERSON.
		Even somebody FAR more mature than a young pregnant woman should not have the power to take the life of an innocent person.
