I've felt so alone all week. She slept all day Sunday.
She has stayed home from work 4 days.
Even though there are plenty of household tasks that she usually does after work, 
even with all of this time off work zero has been accomplished.
She says she'll go to work tomorrow (friday) but I have my doubts.
It seems like I irritate her with my mere presence.
There are big questions, big decisions looming! Some are very close, some others on the horizon.
Where do I go?  What should I do for us?  Where do we move to?
I certainly must not just make these decisions on my own.
I would, but it wouldn't be fair and would cause major conflict.
But trying to talk, even in the form of asking for help, 
runs me up against a wall of her frustration and irritation.
Her final communication early this evening, after our first conversation of the week failed, 
was that she wanted to be left alone the rest of the night.  So here I am again.  Alone.
